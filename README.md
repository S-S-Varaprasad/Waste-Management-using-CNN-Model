# Week-1
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying waste into categories such as Organic and Recyclable. This classification will aid in efficient waste management and recycling processes.
Features:
Image Preprocessing:
The script reads and processes images using OpenCV, converting them to RGB format for model compatibility.
Dataset Handling:
Uses a structured dataset containing labeled images for training and testing.
Data Visualization:
Visualizes the distribution of the dataset using a pie chart to understand the balance between categories.
Prerequisites:
Install the required Python libraries:
pip install opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib pandas tqdm
